## Description

Planning a wedding can be an extremely stressful task! But with an application that helps you plan your wedding, it should help make things a lot easier on the bride and groom! The purpose of this app is to be able to help organize things and keep things in one place so that planning a wedding can be a more enjoyable, and less stressful, experience. The application was built by following the acceptance criterias listed below:

```md
GIVEN an application
WHEN I create a username and password
THEN I am able to log into the application
WHEN I log into the application
THEN I am prompted to the profile page where I can create a new invitee
WHEN I enter a new invitee
THEN I can create a new invitee and send the invitation via QR Code
WHEN I click on venues
THEN I am given a list of venues to choose from
WHEN I click on photographers
THEN I am given a list of photographers to choose from
WHEN I scan the QR Code
THEN I am able to see the invitation to the wedding
WHEN I click logout
THEN I am logged out of my account
```

There was no starter code provided for this challenge! This application was built from scratch! It was built using Sequelize, Express.js, Handlebars.js, and many more! The user can navigate through the application by creating a username and password and that will allow them to navigate through the app!
